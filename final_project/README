This is my final project for Ay250: Python for Data Science.

The two lectures I used are:
    (1) Flask
    (2) Databases

Description: I used a combination of Flask, jinja2, python, html, and css to build a web application to track lunch-hosters for my research group's weekly Friday lunches. This web app allows users to sign-up to provide lunch for a specific date. Some of its features are:
    -flashes a message on the screen when a user has successfully signed up
    -adds the user to the left table, and orders those entries by dates so the most recent date is at the top
    -highlights the closest upcoming lunch with a green arrow on the table, if there is one
    -tallies up how many lunches each person has provided in a table on the right
    -details out instructions on being a lunch-hoster on a separate page

I created a free Google cloud account to host the webpage, and it can be accessed here: http://35.184.149.198/
I deployed it using a Docker container.

The bare-bones version of the webpage launched publicly (aka to my lab) on 4/18/18, but I've been making updates since then too.

Thanks!
