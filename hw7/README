-Homework solutions are contained in "hw_7_assignment.ipynb" 

-Note that most of the code in Problem #2 (Panorama Stitching) comes from a tutorial in scikit-image (https://github.com/scikit-image/skimage-tutorials/blob/master/lectures/solutions/adv3_panorama-stitching-solution.ipynb)
    -I added additional heavy commenting for personal understanding of what's going on
